# hello there!
üêö My name is Cassandra, and I am a rising senior in high school. Welcome to my GitHub portfolio!

# about me
ü§ç My interests lie in data science, design, and machine learning - fields that allow me to uncover patterns, solve real-world problems, and build intelligent systems. One day, I hope to become a data scientist at a startup or at a competitive big tech company, where I can work on innovative, high-impact projects and help shape technology from the ground up. 

üåä Currently: I am a Fellow at The Knowledge House (Karim Kharbouch Coding Fellowship), strengthening my skills in product development and UI/UX design by learning industry-standard front-end development software. Within this competitive capstone fellowship, I‚Äôm building Harbor - a tech startup and AI-powered wellness app that offers personalized support for mental and physical health. Through KKCF, I hope to build on my full-stack development skills while gaining the confidence and tools to effectively pitch my projects to others. 

# what do i hope to learn with github?
With GitHub, I hope to collaborate with my fellow programmers to build software that creates real-world impact. I also aim to gain more confidence in my programming and communication skills through more collaborative projects with GitHub, ultimately preparing me for future endeavors like internships, research opportunities, and prospective jobs.
