# hello there!
üêö My name is Cassandra, and I am a rising senior in high school. 

# about me
ü§ç My interests lie in data science, design, and machine learning - fields that allow me to uncover patterns, solve real-world problems, and build intelligent systems. One day, I hope to become a data scientist at a startup or at a competitive big tech company, where I can work on innovative, high-impact projects and help shape technology from the ground up. 

üî¨ Classes Taken & Past Tech Experiences: 
* I taught myself Python and became the first student in my district to earn a certification. As a freshman, I challenged both AP CSA and AP CSP (scoring a 5 on CSP + being the only freshman to pass CSA). I‚Äôve competed in hackathons like Empower Hacks 2.0 and Boost Hacks II, where I won Best AI Hack out of 1,000+ participants for Vitality, an AI wellness app for first-gen, low-income students.
* I also built a deep learning brain tumor detection model with 98% accuracy and a 0.98 F1-score; won 1st at regionals, the Yale Science & Engineering Award, and qualified for the California State Science Fair in Computational Systems: Medical.
* I was named a 2025 NCWIT California Affiliate Winner, and I‚Äôm deeply committed to equity in tech. I teach orphaned youth in Nigeria basic computer science skills through an international nonprofit, and I founded and lead my school‚Äôs Girls Who Code chapter to empower girls and gender-expansive youth in STEM.

üåä Currently: I am a Fellow at The Knowledge House (Karim Kharbouch Coding Fellowship), strengthening my skills in product development and UI/UX design by learning industry-standard front-end development software. Within this competitive capstone fellowship, I‚Äôm building Harbor - a tech startup and AI-powered wellness app that offers personalized support for mental and physical health. Through KKCF, I hope to build on my full-stack development skills while gaining the confidence and tools to effectively pitch my projects to others. In addition, I‚Äôm also learning Tableau by creating mini dashboards for beauty brands like Rhode.

# github goals
ü•• With GitHub, I hope to collaborate with my fellow programmers to build software that creates real-world impact. I also aim to gain more confidence in my programming and communication skills through more collaborative projects with GitHub, ultimately preparing me for future endeavors like internships, research opportunities, and prospective jobs.
