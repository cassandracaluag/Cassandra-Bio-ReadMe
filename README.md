# hello there!
üêö My name is Cassandra, and I am a rising senior in high school. 

# about me
ü§ç My interests lie in data science, design, and machine learning - fields that allow me to uncover patterns, solve real-world problems, and build intelligent systems. One day, I hope to become a data scientist at a startup or at a competitive big tech company, where I can work on innovative, high-impact projects and help shape technology from the ground up. 

üî¨ Classes Taken & Past Tech Experiences: 
* I taught myself how to code in Python! I became the first student in my entire school district to earn a Python certification.
* I've challenged AP Computer Science A and AP Computer Science Principles concurrently in my freshman year, in which I passed both exams (with a 5 on AP CSP).
* I've also participated in two hackathons: Empower Hacks 2.0 and Boost Hacks II (where I won "Best AI Hacks" out of 1,000+ participants!). In these hackathons, I developed Vitality, an AI-powered app geared towards helping first-generation, low-income students with their mental and physical wellbeing.
* I've developed a deep learning brain tumor detection model with 98% accuracy and a 0.98 F1-score, which earned me first place at my regional science fairs, the Yale Science and Engineering Association Award, and a spot as a state qualifier (Computational Systems: Medical) at the California Science Fair.
* I was also named a 2025 California Affiliate Winner for the NCWIT Aspirations in Computing Award!
* In addition to my accolades and independent pursuit of further knowledge, I enjoy teaching the things that I know to other people, especially those in underrepresented backgrounds. I am a Volunteer Mentor at an international non-profit which teaches orphaned children in Nigeria basic computer science, with an emphasis on coding, in order to help increase technical literacy. Moreover, I founded and serve as the President of my school's Girls Who Code chapter, aiming to spark interest in tech within girls and gender-expansive youth at our school.

üåä Currently: I am a Fellow at The Knowledge House (Karim Kharbouch Coding Fellowship), strengthening my skills in product development and UI/UX design by learning industry-standard front-end development software. Within this competitive capstone fellowship, I‚Äôm building Harbor - a tech startup and AI-powered wellness app that offers personalized support for mental and physical health. Through KKCF, I hope to build on my full-stack development skills while gaining the confidence and tools to effectively pitch my projects to others. In addition, I‚Äôm also learning Tableau by creating mini dashboards for beauty brands like Rhode.

# github goals
ü•• With GitHub, I hope to collaborate with my fellow programmers to build software that creates real-world impact. I also aim to gain more confidence in my programming and communication skills through more collaborative projects with GitHub, ultimately preparing me for future endeavors like internships, research opportunities, and prospective jobs.
